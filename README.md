These are Gordon's configuration files for Emacs.

**init.el**: general settings, non-Evil keybindings.

**evil_customizations.el**: customizations for Evil. 

**mode_customizations.el**: customizations for specific modes.

**bugfixes.el**: customizations of functions from other packages so they work they way I want them to. Not necessarily bug fixes per se.
